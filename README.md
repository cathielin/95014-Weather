# 95014-Weather-App
A weather app created with ReactJS that gives a simple 5 day weather forecast for any zipcode in the US. OpenWeatherAPI provides the forecast information, while Zip-Code API was used for the zipcode look up and valildation.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Important Notes 
Project's API files will be added soon.

## Motivation 
The app was a way for me to practice using ReactJS and building a simple web app.
